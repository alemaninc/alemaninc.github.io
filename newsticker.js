If we subtract 0.5 from both sides, we get 9 + 9.5 = 20.5. Now, when we add 0.5 to both sides, we get 9.5 + 9.5 = 21. Now the two terms on the left side are equal. The next step is to divide both sides by 2 to produce 4.75 + 4.75 = 10.5. Now, we subtract 2.75 from both sides, getting 2 + 4.75 = 7.75. Finally, we subtract 2.75 from both sides again, and so we get our final answer of 2 + 2 = 5!
